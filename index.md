# I. Informal Code Review: 
After you have identified the artifact or artifacts for your ePortfolio, but before you complete the modifications and enhancements, you will produce a code
review video to share your plans for modification and enhancement. Your code review must be present in your ePortfolio, and it must contribute to meeting several of the course
outcomes. Submit your code review in the form of a video presentation or screencast walkthrough. Your audience for this code review is your peers or your manager. Focus on
explaining how your code works and why you will complete the enhancement you are planning; do not worry about getting too technical. Address the following in your code reviews:

    ## A. Existing functionality:
    Provide a detailed walkthrough focused on the features and functionality of the existing code (before enhancements).

## B. Code Analysis:
Target areas for improvement such as structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, security, testing, commenting, and documenting.

## C. Enhancement: 
Provide a walkthrough of planned enhancements that address issues raised in the code analysis. Highlight the specific skills you will demonstrate and address the alignment for each of the five course outcomes across the three categories.

# II. Artifacts: 
Provide at least one (with a maximum of three) artifact representing your growth in the Computer Science program. The artifact should demonstrate enhancements in the following categories:

## A. Software Design and Engineering: 
For this category of enhancement, consider improving a piece of software, transferring a project into a different language, reverse engineering a piece of software for a different operating system, or expanding a project’s complexity.

## B. Algorithms and Data Structures: 
For this category of enhancement, consider improving the efficiency of a project or expanding the complexity of using data structures and algorithms for your artifact.

## C. Databases: 
For this category of enhancement, consider adding more advanced concepts of MySQL, incorporating data mining, creating a MongoDB interface with HTML or
JavaScript, or building a full stack with a different programming language for your ar�fact.

**Additional Notes:**

- You may choose artifacts from the courses listed below.
- You only need to choose one enhancement per category.
- You can choose the same artifact for multiple enhancements.
- The suggestions for each category are just recommendations. Consider being creative and proposing an alternative enhancement to your instructor.
- You are encouraged to include additional materials in your ePortfolio to showcase the full range or depth of your skills and abilities. Your additional materials will not be subject to grading but will be eligible for instructor feedback.

- IT 380: Cybersecurity and Information Assurance

# II. Narratives:
Provide a narrative to accompany each artifact in your ePortfolio. The narrative that you write for each artifact should explain why you included the artifact in your
ePortfolio and reflect on the process you used to create the artifact. The narrative should focus less on the actual creation of the artifact and more on the learning that happened
through the creation of the artifact. Address the following items for each artifact:

## A.
Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

## B. 
Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software
development? How did the enhancement improve the artifact? What specific skills did you demonstrate in the enhancement?

## C. 
Reflect on the process of enhancing the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? How did you incorporate feedback as
you made changes to the artifact? How was the artifact improved? Which course outcomes did you partially or fully meet with your enhancements? Which do you feel were not
met?

# III. Professional Self-Assessment:
For your ePortfolio, you will write a professional self-assessment. In it, you will reflect on the capstone and your experience in the Computer Science program. Your professional self-assessment will serve as the formal introduction to your portfolio. You will add it to the beginning of your portfolio for your final submission in Module Seven.

Employers often interview a number of technically qualified candidates, so you should try to emphasize aspects of your ePortfolio that set you apart and quantifiably illustrate your competence and employability. In addition, the professional self-assessment is an opportunity to showcase your superior computer science knowledge, skills, and expertise. Be sure that your professional self-assessment is well-organized and thoughtful and that it effectively communicates your strengths in the field of computer science. The self-assessment might be a great first draft of a cover letter and useful as you apply for jobs with your new degree. Take advantage of your instructor’s feedback for this reason.

Include the following in your professional self-assessment:

## A. 
Discuss how completing your coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped you showcase your strengths, shape your professional goals and values, and prepare to enter or become more employable in the computer science field.

### 1. 
Use specific examples from your program and include examples outside of the artifacts included in your ePortfolio.

### 2. 
Address the following topics: collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and database, and security. This section should function as an overall introduction to your skills, not a discussion of the artifacts.

## B. 
Summarize and introduce how your artifacts fit together and inform the portfolio as a whole.

### 1. 
This summary will help demonstrate the full range of your computer science talents and abilities.

### 2. 
This section should introduce your audience to the technical artifacts that follow the professional self-assessment.
