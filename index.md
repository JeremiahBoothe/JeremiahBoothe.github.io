# I. Informal Code Review
In this section, I will present a code review video highlighting two critical components of my ePortfolio: a JDBC-HTTP-DATABASE bridge and an Android application. The review will detail the functionalities of each component and outline my plans for future improvements. The video will be accessible to peers or managers, serving as a brief overview of my work.

# A. Existing Functionality

The JDBC-HTTP-DATABASE applicatio

The JDBC-HTTP Database retrieves JSON-formatted data from a specified website and efficiently stores it in both an SQL database and a MongoDB. This approach allows for versatile data storage and easy access via different database technologies. The data is processed and transformed as necessary, ensuring that it fits the requirements of both databases.

The Android Application streams radio from a specified URL, providing real-time artist data to users. It collects and stores played songs in a Room database, presenting this information in a user-friendly CardView and RecyclerView layout. This dual functionality allows users not only to enjoy streaming music but also to track their listening history seamlessly.

B. Code Analysis
During the code analysis, I will identify areas for improvement in both components. For the JDBC-HTTP database, I will examine the efficiency of data retrieval methods, the robustness of error handling, and the clarity of documentation. In the Android application, I will assess the user experience, focusing on streaming quality, the accuracy of artist data, and the Room database's effectiveness in logging played songs. Security measures for both components will also be evaluated to ensure that user data and API interactions are adequately protected.

C. Enhancement
I plan to implement several enhancements for both components. In the JDBC-HTTP database, I aim to optimize the data retrieval process and enhance error handling mechanisms to improve resilience. For the Android application, I plan to introduce features such as user preferences for radio stations and advanced search functionality for logged songs. These enhancements will not only improve user engagement but also showcase my evolving skills in software development.

II. Artifacts
I will present one to three artifacts that reflect my growth within the Computer Science program, specifically focusing on the JDBC-HTTP database and the Android application. Each artifact will be categorized under the following enhancements:

A. Software Design and Engineering
For the JDBC-HTTP database, I will explore improvements in software design by refining data processing and enhancing the architecture to support scalability. In the Android application, I will aim to increase complexity by adding features like user account management, which can enhance user interaction and data handling.

B. Algorithms and Data Structures
I will evaluate the efficiency of data handling in the JDBC-HTTP database by implementing optimized algorithms for data parsing and storage. For the Android application, I will investigate the data structures used in the Room database to improve performance and reduce memory usage while managing the history of played songs effectively.

C. Databases
In the JDBC-HTTP database, I plan to enhance my understanding of SQL and MongoDB by applying advanced querying techniques and exploring data synchronization capabilities. In the Android application, I will work on improving the Room database schema to better accommodate complex data relationships, facilitating more robust data management.
