# Backstory

My road has been a long with with a few detours.  My journey in programming began in mid-nineties. I Started out with some flavor of Basic on an Apple IIe, and moved on to Qbasic around 1995 when I recieved my first Dos/Windows 3.1 PC.  Another year after that I bought the "Learn C in 21 days" book which came with a C compiler and began making a few simple C programs.

Resources in that day, in part due to my remote location, were much harder to come by. Until the late Nineties, I had a few old handme down documentation binders from the eighties, a book on QBasic, and the "C in 21 days book". When the internet first came into existence, it was slow and painful and lacked resources, but shortly after my first 9600 baud rate dial up connection, through AOL Online, I began picking apart HTML files to figure out how to create web sites. I learned most of HTML 4 through this method with no other resources.

When Macromedia flash came out it was a game changer for me, I got ahold of a few of the programs and began creating interactive flash sites, a skill that I would later use to create a website for a metal radio station called Total Distortion, which was run from Ithaca College in Ithaca, NY. 

Before then I graduated High school, and completed an Associates Degree in Information Technology - with a concentration in Network administration at ECPI. Eager to start my career, I began my job search, and ended up moving to Ithaca, NY.  In Ithaca, I worked for a company called Glyph Technologies. Glyph was a company that built audio rackmount units for touring and recording musicians, a perfect pairing with the local Colleges and the Radio and Television programs.

My primary role in the company was production.  I built units, some of which were being used by top touring acts at the time like Justin Timberlake, Brittney Spears and Primus. I still have one of the service request letters from Les Claypool(Primus). I unknowingly had the chance to speak with him to help him troubleshoot but when I was asked to troubleshoot a call with an unknown caller, I had to decline because I already had a full workload, a few hours later I found out that caller was Les Claypool!  The service department would ask me to handle calls occassionally due to my diverse skill set, and when time permitted I would step into the role to take a call or two.

My secondary role in the company, was as the Network Administrators assistant. The lead was more of a software engineer and had to spend much of his time writing code for in house use.  At that time with technology changing at such a break neck pace, it took more up front effort to create custom solutions, as there weren't many ready to go software packages. I alleviated the burden of handling network and general computer issues, which largely consisted of dealing with users that had downloaded malicious code and spread it around the office, pretty much every week. 

The company at the time was still in the realm of startup so the budget and profits which were growing rapidly, were still a bit tight. As an extension of the Network Administrator Assistant and general computer mainentance gig, I repurposed old macs with a variety of issues into working computers that helped expand the departments capabilities. We had a big pile of them in a storage closet, and I picked the most up to date components that supported our needs, and found the components that worked. Saved the company several thousand dollars in expenses as they had just been buying new systems when old ones failed and piling them up.

Then came 9/11. Anyone that existed at that time can vividly recount where they were and what they were doing in that moment. I was sitting at my desk in production building a four drive firewire rackmount unit. I was dating a student at Ithaca College, who was also the producer/host for Total Distortion, the radio station I mentioned earlier. She was from Long Island and her father worked for Verizon and occassionally worked in the Twin Trade Towers. Thankfully he was not in the area on 9/11, but with the phones completely locked up, it was a very stressful day trying to get in contact and find out if her family was ok.

That spiraled into the 2002 dot com crash, an event which led to me losing my job, and unable to find a position. My career was shut down before it really got going.  I was a long way from home, Glyph didn't pay particularly well in the first place, but I had to make a series of choices, favoring eating and having a roof over my head that put me behind very quickly, and I never quite recovered.

A year and a half later, I moved back to my home town, a ten hour drive from Ithaca, with family, and had a few odd jobs as I tried to recover. The job market was brutal. Due to the crash, the bar had been raised dramatically, and suddenly my associates wasn't good enough.  I couldn't afford to go back to school, I couldn't even afford to live.

I did find a job in 2006, with a small local company, in an attempt to restart my career. I was hired because of my ability to think on my feet, plus having all my other experience with hardware and software. It was a fun run, the company basically did whatever anyone needed. I ran 1000's of feet of cable through malls and installed and configured hardware, including Cisco Routers, I did break fix calls, signal analysis, upgrades, and so many other random tech related jobs.  I never knew what I was going to deal with until I arrived on site. 

Doing cable runs to stores in malls was quite an experience. I would show up to a mall 5 hours away only to find out that nothing was prepared, then spend the day aquiring lifts to reach the extremely high cielings, where there were no walkways, had to coordinate between security, mall management, and the store. In a few instances I worked over 24 hours straight, arrive in the morning before opening, spend the entire day/evening until closing handling the logistics, and then further spend the entire night running the cabling, setting up the access points, and getting some basic testing done just in time for the store to open and do a few more tests to ensure the system was operational.

The signal analysis was especially interesting. With the saturation of wifi in some areas, with overlapping channels, I would show up, analyze the signals and determine if the fix was an easy one where I could just change the channel to one that was unused, or if that wasn't an option, I would install boosters and extenders.

That really just begins to cover what I did in the period I worked for G-Tech Networks. I would basically just get a big pile of random tasks that needed to be done with more being added constantly, and was told to figure it out, and I did.

Out of all that chaos there was only one time where I was completely in over my head. I showed up to a facility with Dell Blade servers, which I had never seen before, and every person in the room had at least a Masters and several had PHD's, but none of them could figure out how to use them. I was baffled why they thought I could just show up, with absolutely no prior experience with Dell Blade servers, and do what that highly qualified team was struggling to do.

I really loved much of what I did with G-Tech, and the owner who was my direct boss is still a great friend to this day, but the chaos was just too much and the income was unstable, I would either be getting paid a lot of money, or none at all, depending on the spurts of work, and I wasn't in a life situation where I could manage the instability, financially. So I had to move on to a more stable job, so I tried applying, and while my run at G-Tech was impressive, the two primary reasons I was rejected was "I looked too young" and "You don't have a Bachelors degree or the right Certifications.". 

The next 20 or so years I took over the family upholstery business from my retiring Grandparents, and did a ton of amazing work for all sorts of clients and industries. Whatever it is, if it has fabric on it, I have most likely reupholstered some variation of it, whether home furniture, automotive, boats, historical restorations, even fixed a few stuffed toys.

Throughout that I have continually stayed engaged with technology, through working in different environments such as Unity, Unreal Engine, etc.. It may not have been my day job but it was an important hobby.  Lockdown provided amplie time to rediscover how much I enjoyed developing software and inspired me to get back to my roots.
