# Backstory

My road has been a long with with a few detours.  My journey in programming began in mid-nineties. I Started out with some flavor of Basic on an Apple IIe, and moved on to Qbasic around 1995 when I recieved my first Dos/Windows 3.1 PC.  Another year after that I bought the "Learn C in 21 days" book which came with a C compiler and began making a few simple C programs.

Resources in that day, in part due to my remote location, were much harder to come by. Until the late Nineties, I had a few old handme down documentation binders from the eighties, a book on QBasic, and the "C in 21 days book". When the internet first came into existence, it was slow and painful and lacked resources, but shortly after my first 9600 baud rate dial up connection, through AOL Online, I began picking apart HTML files to figure out how to create web sites. I learned most of HTML 4 through this method with no other resources.

When Macromedia flash came out it was a game changer for me, I got ahold of a few of the programs and began creating interactive flash sites, a skill that I would later use to create a website for a metal radio station called Total Distortion, which was run from Ithaca College in Ithaca, NY. 

Before then I graduated High school, and completed an Associates Degree in Information Technology - with a concentration in Network administration at ECPI. Eager to start my career, I began my job search, and ended up moving to Ithaca, NY.  In Ithaca, I worked for a company called Glyph Technologies. Glyph was a company that built audio rackmount units for touring and recording musicians, a perfect pairing with the local Colleges and the Radio and Television programs.

My primary role in the company was production.  I built units, some of which were being used by top touring acts at the time like Justin Timberlake, Brittney Spears and Primus. I still have one of the service request letters from Les Claypool(Primus). I unknowingly had the chance to speak with him to help him troubleshoot but when I was asked to troubleshoot a call with an unknown caller, I had to decline because I already had a full plate, only to find out later it was Les Claypool!  The service department would ask me to handle calls occassionally due to my diverse skill set, and when time permitted I would step into the role to take a call or two.

My secondary role in the company, was as the Network Administrators assistant. The lead was more of a software engineer and had to spend much of his time writing code for in house use.  At that time with technology changing at such a break neck pace, it took more up front effort to create custom solutions, as there weren't many ready to go software packages. I alleviated the burden of handling network and general computer issues, which largely consisted of dealing with users that had downloaded malicious code and spread it around the office, pretty much every week. 

The company at the time was still in the realm of startup so the budget and profits which were growing rapidly, were still a bit tight. As an extension of the Network Administrator Assistant and general computer mainentance gig, I repurposed old macs with a variety of issues into working computers that helped expand the departments capabilities. We had a big pile of them in a storage closet, and I picked the most up to date components that supported our needs, and found the components that worked. Saved the company several thousand dollars in expenses as they had just been buying new systems when old ones failed and piling them up.

Then came 9/11. Anyone that existed at that time can vividly recount where they were and what they were doing in that moment. I was sitting at my desk in production building a four drive firewire rackmount unit. I was dating a student at Ithaca College, who was also the producer/host for Total Distortion, the radio station I mentioned earlier. She was from Long Island and her father worked for Verizon and occassionally worked in the Twin Trade Towers. Thankfully he was not in the area on 9/11, but with the phones completely locked up, it was a very stressful day trying to get in contact and find out if her family was ok.

That spiraled into the 2002 dot com crash, an event which led to me losing my job, and unable to find a position. My career was shut down before it really got going.  I was a long way from home, Glyph didn't pay particularly well in the first place, but I had to make a series of choices, favoring eating and having a roof over my head that put me behind very quickly, and I never quite recovered.

A year and a half later, I moved back to my home town, a ten hour drive from Ithaca, with family, and had a few odd jobs as I tried to recover. The job market was brutal. Due to the crash, the bar had been raised dramatically, and suddenly my associates wasn't good enough.  I couldn't afford to go back to school, I couldn't even afford to live.

I did find a job in 2006, with a small local company, in an attempt to restart my career. I was hired because of my ability to bounce back and think on my feet, plus having all my other experience with hardware and software. It was a fun run, the company basically did whatever anyone needed. I ran 1000's of feet of cable through malls and installed and configured hardware, including Cisco Routers, I did break fix calls, signal analysis, upgrades, and so many other random tech related fixes.  I never knew what I was going to get into until I arrived, figured out the problem, and fixed it. Doing cable runs to stores in malls was quite an experience. I would show up to a mall 5 hours away only to find out that nothing was prepared, then spend the day aquiring lifts to reach the extremely high cielings, where there were no walkways, and coordinate between security, mall management, the store itself. In a few instances I worked over 24 hours straight, arrive in the morning before opening, spend the entire day/evening until closing handling the logistics, and then further spend the entire night running the cabling, setting up the access points, and getting some basic testing done just in time for the store to open and do a few more tests to ensure the system was operational.

The signal analysis was especially interesting. With the saturation of wifi in some areas, with overlapping channels, I would show up, analyze the signals and determine if the fix was an easy one where I could just change the channel to one that was unused, or if that wasn't an option, I would install boosters and extenders.

That really just begins to cover what I did in the period I worked for G-Tech Networks. I would basically just get a big pile of random tasks that needed to be done with more being added constantly, and was told to figure it out, and I did.

Out of all that chaos there was only one time where I was completely over my head. I showed up to a facility with Dell Blade servers, which I had never seen before, and every person in the room had at least a Masters and several had PHD's, but none of them could figure out how to use them. I was baffled why they thought I could just show up and do what that team was struggling to do, with absolutely no prior experience with Dell Blade servers.

I really loved much of what I did with G-Tech, and the owner who was my direct boss is still a great friend to this day, but the chaos was just too much and the income was unstable, I would either be getting paid a lot of money, or none at all, depending on the spurts of work, and I wasn't in a life situation where I could survive the instability, financially. So I had to move on to a more stable job, so I tried applying, and while my run at G-Tech was impressive, the two primary reasons I was rejected was "I looked too young" and "You don't have a Bachelors degree or the right Certifications.". I had some certifications, through G-Tech, to do some of the work I did I had to take some tests.  

The next 20 or so years I took over the family upholstery business from my retiring Grandparents, and did a ton of amazing work for all sorts of clients and industries.

Throughout that I have continually stayed engaged with technology, through working in different environments such as Unity, Unreal Engine, etc..

## Speed
The initial advantage of a static site over a dynamic, database driven site is the page speed as means a lot less processing has to be done before the page is delivered. Some CMS’s provide caching which means that the first visitor to the page gets a dynamic version and then stores a cache of the page. This means subsequent visitor to the page gets the page quicker than the first. If you have a regularly cleared cache, or low numbers of visitors, subsequent visitors may not benefit from the caching and would all experience the increased load times. 

## Version Control
The next advantage of a static site is that it is that it can be version controlled. Usually a CMS relies on a database, which means that if you delete a page or some page content you either have to have revisions enabled in your CMS so you can roll back to a previous version or you need regular backups of your database so you can roll that back to a previous version. A static site with version control means you can easily revert to a previous version of your site and content without the need for database manipulation. 

## Data Files
Static sites, such as Jekyll, also offer a way of storing data in a more human readable format, such as yaml or JSON. This means you can store data that is used in multiple places across your site in one file and reference it in many places. For example, you may have a data file containing products, which you want to list in a category page and a product details page and maybe feature it on the homepage as well. These files can also be version controlled, meaning any changes or updates to your datafiles can be undone easily. The files can also be easily edited in a text editor so if you need to make multiple product amends, such as updating a misspelt brand name you can use something as simple as find and replace to update the spelling in all places at once without having to navigate to multiple different pages in a CMS. 

## Design Freedom
The biggest benefit I find to a static site is there is more freedom for a frontend developer and how they design and build your site. Some CMS’s work in a particular way and you are limited by the way they work. Page builders are available for many CMS’s but it often results in a lot of effort to get a particular piece of content in a particular place on the page. 

A static site generator gives you more freedom to write your own html and text onto the page in the format you want it, rather than having to customise or overwrite the html and css classes output by the page builder tool. 

## Data Protection
A lot of people like the idea of installing a plugin into a CMS to handle things such as contact forms, so people can contact you about something, but in all honesty, it’s easier just to have an email address on the page that users can click on and email you directly. The reason I say this is that you have to try and prevent spam emails by using some kind of captcha on the form, as well as maintaining an email service that will handle the form submission and either store the form data somewhere on your site or send it to you as an email. This is pretty basic stuff, but is further complicated by data privacy laws that dictate how you store customers data and how you protect it. I know a lot of small business users would prefer to not have the hassle of managing stored user data on their site. 

## Security
One last thing to consider is website security. There is always a chance that using a popular CMS will leave your site vulnerable as there are always security issues being identified. You need to constantly keep your site up to date and lock down the CMS login as secure as possible. With a static site, there is no login screen. The original content lives somewhere else and the compiled, generated html is all that needs to be uploaded to your website, minimising the risk. Any public facing website has some risk but anything you can do to minimise it is better for your website in the long run. 

## What will you use on your next project?
A static site may not be the first thing you consider when building your new website, but it’s definitely worth exploring the pros and cons before you start the next project. After all, a faster, more secure site is better for you and your visitors.
